# Day 6 - Filtering Data with HAVING Clause ‚≠ê
- Today, I learned how to use the **HAVING Clause** to filter grouped data using aggregate functions after applying GROUP BY, along with WHERE for row-level filtering.
---

## HAVING Clause ‚≠ê
- The HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter groups of data after they are grouped using GROUP BY.
- Unlike WHERE, which filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups after aggregation.
---

## Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column, AGG_FUNC(column)
FROM table
[WHERE condition]
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition_on_aggregated_data;
```
