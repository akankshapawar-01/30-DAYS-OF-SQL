# Day 5 ‚Äì Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY Clause ‚≠ê
- Today, I learned how to use **Aggregate Functions** in SQL to perform calculations on data and how to group results using the **GROUP BY** clause.
---

## ‚≠ê **Aggregate Functions**  
- Functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.
- **When to use:** When you need summaries like totals, averages, counts, or extremes (min/max) from your dataset.  

### Common Aggregate Functions:
- `COUNT()` ‚Üí Counts rows  
- `SUM()` ‚Üí Adds up numeric values  
- `AVG()` ‚Üí Calculates average values  
- `MAX()` ‚Üí Finds the highest value  
- `MIN()` ‚Üí Finds the lowest value  

## Example:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
```
--- 

## ‚≠ê GROUP BY Clause
- Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
- **When to use:** When you want aggregate results per category (e.g., per department).
- Example:
```sql
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```
