## Day 1 – Introduction to SQL & Dataset Setup

## 🧐 What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized language used to interact with relational databases.  
It allows you to:
- 🏗️ Create and modify database structures
- 📝 Insert, update, and delete records
- 🔍 Retrieve and analyze data efficiently
- 🔐 Ensure data integrity through constraints and relationships
---

## 💡 Need for SQL
- 📂 **Data Management** – Organizes and maintains large datasets  
- 📊 **Data Analysis** – Extracts meaningful insights from data  
- 🌍 **Universally Used** – Works with all major databases (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.) 
---

🧠 Additional Things to Know About SQL
- SQL is case-insensitive, but keywords are often written in uppercase for readability.
- SQL works with tables, which consist of rows (records) and columns (fields).
- Relational databases allow tables to connect through primary and foreign keys.

- You will frequently use CRUD operations:
1. **Create** → `INSERT`
2. **Read** → `SELECT`
3. **Update** → `UPDATE`
4. **Delete** → `DELETE`

## 📊 Dataset Setup
For this 30-day practice, I am using the HR Dataset, which includes tables like:
- 👤 employees
- 🏢 departments
---

## 📄 Files Attached:
- create_tables.sql –> Script to create the HR database schema
- insert_data.sql –> Script to populate the tables with sample data
-  Run these scripts in MySQL to set up your database environment.
---

## 🎯 Day 1 Objectives
- ✅ Set up the HR database using the provided SQL scripts
- ✅ Verified schema and relationships between tables
- ✅ Explored database structure to prepare for queries
---

## 🚀 What’s Next?
On Day 2, I will:
- Practice basic SELECT statements to fetch data from tables
- Understand how to filter results using simple conditions
