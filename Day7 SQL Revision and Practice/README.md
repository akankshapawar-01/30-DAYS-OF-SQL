# Day 7 - SQL Revision and Practice
- Today I revised and practice SQL queries learned from Day 1 to Day 6 â€” covering filtering, sorting, aggregation, grouping, and the use of the HAVING clause.
---

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Queries Practiced
- `WHERE`, `BETWEEN` for filtering rows
- `ORDER BY` for sorting results
- `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()` for aggregation
- `GROUP BY` to summarize data
- `HAVING` to filter grouped data
---

### ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- WHERE filters rows, while HAVING filters groups (after aggregation).
- GROUP BY is useful to get summaries per department, year, etc.
- Sorting (ORDER BY) helps display data meaningfully (e.g., top salaries).
- Using BETWEEN, DISTINCT, and functions like YEAR() improves clarity and precision in filtering.

### ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?
On Day 8, I will:
- Learn about the JOINS (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN)
